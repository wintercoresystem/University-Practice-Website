# University Practice: Website Creation

This project is a university practice exercise for creating a website using HTML, CSS, and js.
However I added flask for scalability, if I want to continue project for my own blog and Bootstrap 5 for fast css layout.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple website that demonstrates the use of different technologies such as Python Flask for the backend, HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, Bootstrap 5 for responsive design, and a JavaScript for interactive functionality.

## Features

- Pretty good interface. 
- Homepage and links to detailed book reviews (for now static html pages, but it's easy to make dynamic using flask forms)
